## AtliQ Grand: Unveiling Key Findings and Analysis  :

- **Problem Statment:**

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

- **Project objective:** 

    **1.** Create a metric list.

    **2.** Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.

    **3.** Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/ mock-up dashboard.


## Project Insights :


    **1.** Considering the current time frame, with AtliQ Seasons experiencing an occupancy rate below 50%, exploring the option of room rent reduction is under consideration

    **2.** AtliQ Exotica stands out as one of the top-performing hotels across various cities, excelling in both revenue and occupancy percentages. Exploring the potential for a slight room rent increase is being considered.

    **3.** AtliQ Bay in Mumbai has the lowest average rating and occupancy percentage compared to its peer hotels.
